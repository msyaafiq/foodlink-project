I am a final-year Computer Science student at UPM, specializing in Computer Networks. My academic journey has equipped me with a solid grasp of the field, and I've gained practical skills in web development and network configuration. I am now actively pursuing an internship opportunity from March to September 2024, aiming to apply my knowledge.
